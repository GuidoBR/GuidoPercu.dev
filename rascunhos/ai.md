### Introduction (2 paragraphs)

For your introduction, consider:

- Opening with a compelling hook about the rapid transformation of software development due to AI
- Briefly mentioning how tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude started the revolution
- Setting up the thesis that while AI is changing workflows, it's creating new opportunities for engineers who adapt

### Learnings from building with AI

This section has good focus areas. Consider adding:

- Brief examples for each learning point
- For "Responsibility" - discuss how engineers must verify AI-generated code
- For "Good prompts" - mention the skill of effectively communicating with AI tools
- For "Context" - explain how providing proper context to AI leads to better results

### Section: IDEs

Your focus on modern AI-enhanced IDEs is excellent. Consider:

- Comparing traditional vs. AI-enhanced IDEs
- Specific features that make Cursor or WindSurf different from standard VSCode
- How these tools change the coding workflow (auto-completion, refactoring, explanation)

### Section: Agents

For Claude Code and similar tools:

- Define what "agents" mean in this context
- How they differ from integrated IDE features
- Examples of autonomous tasks they can perform

### MCPs (Machine Coding Platforms)

I'm assuming this refers to platforms like Replit's Ghostwriter or similar:

- Define MCPs for readers who may be unfamiliar
- Specific examples of complex tasks they can handle
- Security section is crucial - good focus

### Site builders and no-code tools

Good selection of modern tools. Consider:

- How these differ from earlier no-code generations
- The role of AI in making them more powerful
- Where they still fall short compared to custom development

### Software engineers' skills and relevance

This is perhaps your most important section. Consider:

- The shifting focus from writing algorithms to architecture and design
- Human creativity and problem understanding as irreplaceable
- New skills: prompt engineering, AI collaboration, validation
