### [1- The Far Side of the World, by Patrick O Brian](http://www.amazon.com/Side-World-Aubrey-Maturin-Novels/dp/0393308626) ###
Tenth book from the series, the last book from the Master and Commander series by Patrick O Brian published in Brazil. I really enjoyed
reading this series, it is like a old friend. This is not the best book, but it made me feel kinda sad when it finished.

I find it very important to know the history of the field we are working on. In this excellent book, Walter Isaacson tells the history of
the digital revolution. From Ada Lovelace first programmer to Google and Wikipedia. Fascinating read.

This books helped me understand a lot of mistakes we does when we make decisions. Why should I fear terrorism if car accidents are much
more likely? How to measure the performance of an investment fund without being biased? In summary, it is a good book with a list of 
mistakes and cognitive biases to which we are prone.
