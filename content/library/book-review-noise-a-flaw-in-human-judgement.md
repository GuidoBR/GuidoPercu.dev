> Measurement, in everyday life as in science, is the act of usingan instrument to assign a value on a scale to an object orevent. You measure the length of a carpet in inches, using a tape measure. You measure the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit or Celsiusby consulting a thermometer. The act of making a judgment is similar. When judges determinethe appropriate prison term for a crime, they assign a value on a scale.So do underwriters when they set a dollar value to insure a risk, ordoctors when they make a diagnosis. (The scale need not be numerical: “guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,” “advanced melanoma,” and “surgery is recommended” are judgments, too.) **Judgment can therefore be described as measurement in whichthe instrument is a human mind.**

Ten years after "Thinking Fast and Slow", Daniel Kahneman writes another great book about human judgement and decision making. On “Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgement” Kahneman (with Cass Sunstein and Olivier Sibony) focuses on how we make noisy decisions in our daily life and in our professional environments.

> Noise is variability in judgments that should be identical.

The authors define Noise as “the unwanted variability of judgments” where bias are systematic errors in the same direction. Today we’re very focused on eliminating or at least reducing bias and the book argues that noise is just as important a matter to focus on.

The book is full of examples of fields where there are noisy decisions, including medicine, justice, business and surprisingly (at least for me) fingerprint analysis.

The book is structured as a set of 6 parts and three very useful appendices. In the first part, the authors define what Noise is, and how it affects the criminal justice system. In the second part, it introduces us to how to measure errors (bias and noise) using a concept called mean squared error. In the next 4 parts they use those concepts to analyse noise in different situations including project estimation, hiring, feedback cycles and much more.

> As I always suspected, ideas about politics and economics are a lot like movie stars. If people think that other people like them, such ideas can go far.

In chapter 8, there's an interesting discussion about what makes some ideas popular and how this can be misused to influence political opinion. It’s also described how people discussing together in a group can become more extremist in their ideas. This discussion together with the book “Rules of Contagion” illuminated my world view on why the world is so polarized and with more extreme ideas circulating in the news and social media.

There are some very important discussions about using algorithms and machine learning systems which can produce bias. They cite the book “Algorithms of Math Destruction” and argue that we should do better algorithms:

> These examples and many others lead to an inescapable conclusion: although a predictive algorithm in an uncertain world is unlikely to be perfect, it can be far less imperfect than noisy and often ­biased human judgment. This superiority holds in terms ofboth validity (good algorithms almost always predict better) and discrimination (good algorithms can be less biased than human judges). If algorithms make fewer mistakes than human experts do and yetwe have an intuitive preference for for people, then our intuitive preferences should be carefully examined

In my opinion the most practical chapters are the appendices, because they are really useful and practical and can be applied in most companies. Appendix A explains how to conduct a Noise audit, so we can understand how much noise is present in the institution's decision process. Appendix B is a checklist for decision observers (the professional that will help a team to make better decisions). Appendix C tells us how to improve predictions.

Important chapters:

- 5 - Measuring Error
- 8 - How Groups Amplify Noise
- 12 - The Valley of the Normal
- 19 - Debiasing and Decision Hygiene
- 20 - Sequencing Information in Forensic Science
- 21 - Selection and Aggregation in Forecasting
- 22 - Guidelines in Medicine
- 24 - Structure in Hiring
- Review and Conclusion: Taking Noise Seriously
- Appendix A: How to Conduct a Noise Audit
- Appendix B: A Checklist for a Decision Observer
- Appendix C: Correcting Predictions

Together with Kahneman's previous work, this is a very important book that is worth to be re-read from time to time for it’s practical and philosophical value.
