### Highlights

> ### All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from **compound interest**.

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer
time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Understand ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your
financial freedom.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">Money is how we transfer wealth. Money is social credits. It is the ability to have credits and debits of other
people’s time. If I do my job right, if I create value for society, society says, “Oh, thank you. We owe you
something in the future for the work you did in the past. Here’s a little IOU. Let’s call that money.” Wealth
is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out
things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money
in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">But you can improve sales skills. You can read Robert Cialdini, you can go to a sales training seminar, you can
do door-to-door sales. It is brutal but will train you very quickly. You can definitely improve your sales skills.
Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> The best jobs are neither decreed nor degreed. They are creative expressions of continuous learners in free markets.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote">But you can improve sales skills. You can read Robert Cialdini, you can go to a sales training seminar, you can

Specific knowledge cannot be taught, but it can be learned.</blockquote>

------------

<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> For example, I love to read, and I love technology. I learn very quickly, and I get bored fast. If I had gone into a
profession where I was required to tunnel down for twenty years into the same topic, it wouldn’t have worked.
I’m in venture investing, which requires me to come up to speed very, very quickly on new technologies (and
I’m rewarded for getting bored because new technologies come along). It matches up pretty well with my
specific knowledge and skill sets.

</blockquote>

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> The most important skill for getting rich is becoming a perpetual learner. You have to know how to learn
anything you want to learn.

</blockquote>

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> Build or Buy Equity in a Business If you don’t own a piece of a business, you don’t have a path towards
financial freedom.

</blockquote>

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small
shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company.
Ownership is really important.

</blockquote>

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> Literally, being anti-wealth will prevent you from becoming wealthy, because you will not have the right
mindset for it, you won’t have the right spirit, and you won’t be dealing with people on the right level. Be
optimistic, be positive. It’s important. Optimists actually do better in the long run.

</blockquote>

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking
wealth creation are often just seeking status.

</blockquote>

> ### **Retirement** is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> Money is not the root of all evil; there’s nothing evil about it. But the lust for money is bad. The lust for money
is not bad in a social sense. It’s not bad in the sense of “you’re a bad person for lusting for money.” It’s bad for
you. Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love
money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and
doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number. The punishment for the love
of money is delivered at the same time as the money. As you make money, you just want even more, and you
become paranoid and fearful of losing what you do have. There’s no free lunch.
</blockquote>

------------
<blockquote class="otro-blockquote"> 
No book in the library should scare you. Whether it’s a math, physics, electrical engineering, sociology, or
economics book. You should be able to take any book down off the shelf and read it. A number of them are
going to be too difficult for you. That’s okay—read them anyway. Then go back and reread them and reread
them.

> ###  Doctors won’t make you **healthy**. Nutritionists won’t make you **slim**. Teachers won’t make you **smart**. Gurus won’t make you **calm**. Mentors won’t make you **rich**. Trainers won’t make you **fit**. Ultimately, you have to take responsibility. **Save yourself**.
