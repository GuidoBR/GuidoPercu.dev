# How I Passed the AWS Certified Developer Associate Exam: My Study Strategy

   Preparing for the AWS Certified Developer Associate exam can feel overwhelming, especially with the vast amount of material to cover. I recently passed the exam, and here’s a breakdown of how I structured my study plan and resources, which might help you as well.

   ### 1. **Course Overview**
   I started with an [**AWS Developer Associate course**]((https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/?couponCode=ST22MT92324B)) on Udemy, which you can find [here]. Although it’s packed with information, I found it a bit boring at times. To avoid getting bogged down in details, I focused on having a **high-level understanding of all the services**. This helped me grasp the bigger picture without getting lost in specifics early on.

   ### 2. **Practice Exams**
   I also made use of Udemy's [**practice exams**](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01/?couponCode=ST22MT92324B) from the same instructor. These were a game changer. After each test, I’d **write down the questions I got wrong** and look up the relevant AWS documentation to deepen my understanding of services I was less familiar with. This method helped me target weak areas efficiently.

   ### 3. **The Official Study Guide**
   For additional reading, I found a copy of the **AWS Certified Developer Official Study Guide** at my local library in Toronto. The book is also available [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Developer-Official-Study-Guide/dp/1119508193). I focused on reading chapters about services I wasn’t as comfortable with. I enjoyed using the book as it gave me a break from the computer screen and helped reinforce key concepts in a different format.

   ### 4. **Cheat Sheets for Quick Review**
   I also relied on [**cheat sheets** from Digital Cloud Training]((https://digitalcloud.training/category/aws-cheat-sheets/aws-developer-associate/?megamenu), specifically tailored to the AWS Developer Associate exam. These provided concise summaries of important topics and services, making them great for quick review sessions.

   ### 5. **Final Week of Study**
   In the final week leading up to the exam, I followed a structured routine:
   - **Re-read the book** chapters on topics I found tricky.
   - **Took more practice exams** to gauge my progress.
   - **Wrote down important points** in a notebook, especially the ones I thought would be helpful to memorize.

   This combination of reading, taking practice exams, and writing things down helped cement the information in my mind.

   ### 6. **Time Investment**
   In total, I dedicated about **four weeks** to studying, leveraging my existing experience from past projects at Pfizer, especially those involving serverless technologies. It’s a lot to absorb, but manageable if you break it down systematically.

   ### 7. **Exam vs. Practice Tests**
   One interesting thing I noticed: **the practice exams were harder than the actual certification exam**. My scores on the real exam were better than on the practice tests, which was a pleasant surprise.

   ### Conclusion
   The AWS Certified Developer Associate exam is challenging, but with the right resources and study strategy, it’s definitely achievable. Focusing on a high-level understanding, targeting weak spots through practice, and reviewing key concepts with cheat sheets were crucial to my success. If you’re preparing for the exam, I hope this breakdown helps you on your journey!
